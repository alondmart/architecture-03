Hello my name is Alondra and I'm filming my video a bit late so there's not really anybody to talk to um so I just decided that I would review some things that I own and the first thing that I'd like to talk about is this water bottle that my mom got me it was like seven bucks and it's spill resistant so like if you knock it over really quick it won't spill um a bunch of water everywhere the next thing that I have is this fan it's a handheld fan F I really like it I've had it for a couple years and it has three settings which is really cool and it has this cute little strap that you can put on your wrist so if you drop it it doesn't fall oh I got it on sale too it was like 13 bucks and next is my airpod case I really like it cuz it glows in the dark so I think it's cool and the top is like connected on the back so if it like falls off the top it doesn't you don't completely lose the top which is what happened to my last one and lastly is my Kindle I love my Kindle I got it as a Christmas gift from my sisters and I really like it I've read so many books so far and yeah love my Kindle and that is it
