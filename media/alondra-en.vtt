hello my name is Alandra and I'm filming

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.720
my video a bit late so there's not

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.880
really anybody to talk to um so I just

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.440
decided that I would review some things

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.080
that I own and the first thing that I'd

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.520
like to talk about is this water bottle

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.480
that my mom got me it was like seven

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.119
bucks and it's spill resistant so like

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.119
if you knock it over really quick it

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:28.279
won't spill um a bunch of water

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.679
everywhere the next thing that I have is

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.520
this fan it's a handheld fan F I really

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.239
like it I've had it for a couple years

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.719
and it has three settings which is

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.239
really cool and it has this cute little

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.120
strap that you can put on your wrist so

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.520
if you drop it it doesn't fall oh I got

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.960
it on sale too it was like 13 bucks and

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.520
next is my airpod case I really like it

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.079
cuz it glows in the dark so I think it's

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.039
cool and the top is like connected on

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.879
the back so if it like falls off the top

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.359
it doesn't you don't completely lose the

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.399
top which is what happened to my last

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.960
one and lastly is my Kindle I love my

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.240
Kindle I got it as a Christmas gift for

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.479
my sisters and I really like it I've

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.439

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.439
